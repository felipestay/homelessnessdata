About us
======
I am Felipe Estay, a researcher and a member of the board at CISCAL (Center of Research and Advocacy about Homelessness - ciscal.org). I utilise my personal academic website as a platform for disseminating data and research findings related to this urgent issue. This website serves not only as a knowledge repository but also as a collaborative hub, bringing together researchers, policymakers, activists, and community members. It fosters a sense of shared responsibility in addressing homelessness. By providing a space for exchanging ideas, best practices, and innovative approaches, it encourages fruitful discussions and the development of effective strategies.

Community engagement is central to our mission. The website acts as a bridge between academia and the broader community, making research accessible and understandable to individuals from all walks of life. Our goal is to translate complex research findings into practical information, empowering individuals and organizations to actively participate in tackling homelessness. Through this personal and collective project, we strive to raise awareness, challenge stereotypes, and advocate for policy changes that prioritize affordable housing, social support, and holistic solutions. Together, we can create a society where everyone has access to safe and stable housing, ensuring that no one is left without a place to call home.
